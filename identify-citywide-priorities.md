# Lay the Foundation
## Identify Citywide Priorities
While the city uncovers its data assets, the principal should begin to think about the city’s priorities, which are desired outcomes for the entire city. These priorities may be informed by a formal citywide comprehensive plan or strategic framework, business plan, sustainability plan, campaign priorities, items mentioned in a state of the city address, or by stated strategic goals. The principal should consider all potential forums in which strategic priorities may have been stated, and all potential subject matter areas. These areas are generally consistent across governments, and may fall into the following categories.

1. Public safety
1. Public health
1. Education
1. Sustainability and the environment
1. Jobs and the economy
1. Government operations and management


| Evidence of Citywide Priorities |
| --- |
| **Bridgeport, CT**: The City of Bridgeport created a [Master Plan of Conservation & Development](https://www.bridgeportct.gov/filestorage/89013/89319/MasterPlanofConservationandDevelopment.pdf) (“Master Plan”) to determine its course for revitalization. The Master Plan acknowledged that “the time is right for a renaissance in Bridgeport,” and the city is poised to become a regional destination. Bridgeport is also part of a [Regional Comprehensive Plan](http://www.gbrct.org/projects/land-use/reconnect/#.VZqoXxNVikp), which provides context for local and regional decision making. Bridgeport has created a Neighborhood Revitalization Zone Strategic Plan of Action as well as a [Parks Master Plan](http://bridgeportct.gov/filestorage/89019/95776/103881/Bridgport_Parks_Manual_2012_print%2Bversion.pdf). Although Bridgeport has not created a comprehensive strategic plan, it is safe to say that revitalization and planning are priorities for the City. |
| **Seattle, WA**: In 2012, Seattle’s energy utility, Seattle City Light, completed a [strategic planning process](http://www.seattle.gov/light/stratplan/futureStratPlan.asp) to develop a roadmap to meet customers needs and enhance community engagement and environmental leadership. Since 1994, Seattle has used its comprehensive plan to guide city growth, and a [Transportation Strategic Plan](http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/tsphome.htm) to guide the work of Seattle’s Department of Transportation. These documents are a great starting point for developing goals related to growth and sustainability.|
| **Syracuse, NY**: An update to its Comprehensive Plan 2025, the City of Syracuse’s [Comprehensive Plan 2040](http://www.syrgov.net/planning.aspx) is made up of several components: Land Use and Development Plan, Sustainability Plan, Historic Preservation Plan, Syracuse Bicycle Plan, Public Art Plan, Pedestrian Infrastructure Plan, and Parks and Open Space. The plan also takes into account the city’s TNT (Tomorrow’s Neighborhood Today) Plans, Capital Improvement Program, Neighborhood and Business Development, and Transportation. With its Comprehensive Plan, Syracuse has clearly established its priorities and provided guidance for implementation by City departments.|
